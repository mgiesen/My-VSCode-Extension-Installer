# VS Code Extension Installer

This repository contains a Bash script for installing a set of useful Visual Studio Code extensions. The script is handy for quickly setting up a development environment with predefined extensions.

## How It Works

The script performs the following steps:

1. **Lists Already Installed Extensions:** First, the script displays a list of currently installed extensions in VS Code.
   
2. **Presents a List of Extensions to Install:** Next, the script shows a list of predefined extensions that are to be installed.

3. **Installation Process:** Upon the user's confirmation, the script installs the extensions and provides feedback on the success or failure of each installation.

## Usage

To use the script, clone the repository and run the script in a Bash environment. Confirm the installation of the extensions by pressing 'Enter'.

```bash
./install_vscode_extensions.sh
```
